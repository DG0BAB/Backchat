	/// 100: This means that the server has received the request headers, and that the client should proceed to send the request body (in the case of a request for which a body needs to be sent; for example, a POST request). If the request body is large, sending it to a server when a request has already been rejected based upon inappropriate headers is inefficient. To have a server check if the request could be accepted based on the request's headers alone, a client must send Expect: 100-continue as a header in its initial request and check if a 100 Continue status code is received in response before continuing (or receive 417 Expectation Failed and not continue).

	/// 302: This is an example of industry practice contradicting the standard. The HTTP/1.0 specification (RFC 1945 required the client to perform a temporary redirect (the original describing phrase was "Moved Temporarily"),[6] but popular browsers implemented 302 with the functionality of a 303 See Other. Therefore, HTTP/1.1 added status codes 303 and 307 to distinguish between the two behaviours.[7] However, some Web applications and frameworks use the 302 status code as if it were the 303.[8]
	case found = 302

	case seeOther = 303

	/// 304: Indicates that the resource has not been modified since the version specified by the request headers If-Modified-Since or If-None-Match. This means that there is no need to retransmit the resource, since the client still has a previously-downloaded copy.
	case notModified = 304

In contrast to how 302 was historically implemented, the request method is not allowed to be changed when reissuing the original request. For instance, a POST request should be repeated using another POST request.[12]

So, for example, submitting a form to a permanently redirected resource may continue smoothly.[13]

	case badRequest = 400

	/// 401: Similar to 403 Forbidden, but specifically for use when authentication is required and has failed or has not yet been provided. The response must include a WWW-Authenticate header field containing a challenge applicable to the requested resource. See Basic access authentication and Digest access authentication.

	/// 402: Reserved for future use. The original intention was that this code might be used as part of some form of digital cash or micropayment scheme, but that has not happened, and this code is not usually used. YouTube uses this status if a particular IP address has made excessive requests, and requires the person to enter a CAPTCHA.[citation needed]

	/// 409: Indicates that the request could not be processed because of conflict in the request, such as an edit conflict in the case of multiple updates.
	case conflict = 409

	/// 410: Indicates that the resource requested is no longer available and will not be available again. This should be used when a resource has been intentionally removed and the resource should be purged. Upon receiving a 410 status code, the client should not request the resource again in the future. Clients such as search engines should remove the resource from their indices.[16] Most use cases do not require clients and search engines to purge the resource, and a "404 Not Found" may be used instead.

	/// 415: The request entity has a media type which the server or resource does not support. For example, the client uploads an image as image/svg+xml, but the server requires that images use a different format.
	case unsupportedMediaType = 415

	case requestedRangeNotSatisfiable = 416

	/// 417: The server cannot meet the requirements of the Expect request-header field.
	case expectationFailed = 417

	/// 418: This code was defined in 1998 as one of the traditional IETF April Fools' jokes, in RFC 2324, Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol, and is not expected to be implemented by actual HTTP servers. The RFC specifies this code should be returned by tea pots requested to brew coffee.
	case imATeapot = 418

	/// 419: Not a part of the HTTP standard, 419 Authentication Timeout denotes that previously valid authentication has expired. It is used as an alternative to 401 Unauthorized in order to differentiate from otherwise authenticated clients being denied access to specific server resources.[citation needed]

	/// 426: The client should switch to a different protocol such as TLS/1.0, given in the Upgrade header field.
	case upgradeRequired = 426

	/// 428: The origin server requires the request to be conditional. Intended to prevent "the 'lost update' problem, where a client GETs a resource's state, modifies it, and PUTs it back to the server, when meanwhile a third party has modified the state on the server, leading to a conflict."[19]

	/// 451: Defined in the internet draft "A New HTTP Status Code for Legally-restricted Resources".[23] Intended to be used when resource access is denied for legal reasons, e.g. censorship or government-mandated blocked access. A reference to the 1953 dystopian novel Fahrenheit 451, where books are outlawed.[24]
